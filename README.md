## About Me

Howdy üëã, I'm Paul Okstad. I'm a software engineer based in Southern California.

### Work History

I have been writing code in exchange for money since 2006.
I started off my career at a defense contractor (Boeing), then left to produce a best selling iOS app (You Are Your Own Gym).
I then worked at a small startup (SmartEdge) and then a larger one (GitLab).
Today I work on ecommerce related work for a cybersecurity company (CrowdStrike).

### üè° WFH History & Philosophy

I have been working from home in some capacity since 2014.
I have worked both for hybrid teams split between remote workers and üè¢ office workers and on a totally geographically distributed üåé open source team.

I love working from home because of the work life balance it provides me.
WFH also provides a more distraction free environment for heads down work.

Many companies tried WFH during COVID, but many of them did not have WFH in their DNA.
WFH was simply a bandaid they applied when they needed to.
Too many companies relied on face-to-face collaboration to drive productivity.
Collaborating from home behind a computer doesn't come natural.

When COVID started, I was working at a totally remote company, GitLab.
GitLab was a leader in the WFH-mindspace for software companies by publishing an [open source handbook on remote work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
While working there, I became indoctrinated into the async-philosophy of working on a distributed team.
Some key take aways:

- Treat all interactions like a aequential stream of requests.

There are times when I miss being in an office and having human connection with my colleagues.
